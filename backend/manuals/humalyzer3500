NOTICE
Analytical instruments for in vitro diagnostic application involve the handling of human samples and controls
which should be considered at least potentially infectious. Therefore every part and accessory of the respective
instrument which may have come into contact with such samples must equally be considered as potentially
infectious.
BIOHAZARD
The „BIOHAZARD“ warning label must be affixed to instrument prior to first use with biological material !
Servicing Note:
Before doing any servicing on the instrument it is very important to thoroughly disinfect all possibly contaminated
parts. Before the instrument is removed from the laboratory for disposal or servicing, it must be decontaminated.
Decontamination should be performed by authorised well-trained personnel only, observing all necessary safety
precautions. Instruments to be returned have to be accompanied by a decontamination certificate completed by
the responsible laboratory manager. If a decontamination certificate is not supplied, the returning laboratory will
be responsible for charges resulting from non-acceptance of the instrument by the servicing centre, or from
authority’s interventions.

2.3
Location of the Instrument
The instrument should be located in a clean environment, placed on a stable surface, and away from direct
sunlight, which could affect the operating temperature and the quantity of light measured by the instrument.
The following points should be taken into consideration.
-
Ensure that it is on a level surface.
-
Avoid positions subject to jerks or vibrations.
-
Make sure that the instrument is not placed close to air conditioning or heat sources.
-
For the long life of the instrument these temperature conditions should be followed:
5°C
-
50°C for instrument storage.
15°C
-
30°C for instrument use.
2.4
Power supply connection
-
Please check the setting of the power supply switch according to your country’s electrical network.
-
Connect the power plug to a good grounded AC wall outlet, preferably one that is not shared with other
electric appliances and with low fluctuation of line voltage compared to the standard voltage specified
(10-15%).
-
Keep the instrument away from other appliances that generate high frequency electrical noises (e.g.
radiological instruments).
-
Before connecting the power cord, check that the AC power supply corresponds to the value that is
stated on the instrument’s label.
2.5
Caution
Do not connect the instrument to a power supply different from the value indicated on the label.
-
Before connecting the power and finishing the installation section, make sure that the instrument is turned
off (check the polysnap located on the rear part of the instrument).
-
Make sure that your AC main line has an efficient ground line. A bad ground line connection may
compromise analysis results and damage the instrument.
-
After turning on the instrument, pay attention not to spill liquids or micro solid substances on the surface
around the instrument.
-
Keep the instrument away from young children.
If the above procedures are carefully followed, it will be possible to TURN ON the instrument by using the switch
located on the polysnap block.
2.6
Measurement block
Open the measurement block cover lid, positioned on the top left part of the instrument. Inside you will see:
-
Peristaltic pump that allows the solution to enter the instrument for measurement.
-
Incubator well which keeps the flow-cell or manual cuvette at the temperature of approximately 37° C.
-
Inlet tube.
6/36
2.7
Tube setting
Make sure that the transparent tube (the one that connects the flow-cell with the internal hydraulic circuit) is not
twisted or squashed.
Place the red tube around the peristaltic pump and make sure that the white plastic connections are set as shown
in the figure below:
Under the measurement block there is a lever (the PUSH button). Press the lever for no more than half a second to
pump samples into the flow cell.

Tension Mode Measurement
In “READING ABS” screen you can monitor (after having filled water) tension coming from optical group (OPT TENS)
and tension coming in A/D converter (A/D TENS) , using a particular filter (FILTER)
Tension Mode Measurement is very useful to verify lamp calibration, filter / lamp / lens / photodiode / preamp
board quality, position sensor working.
Moreover in this screen you can test correct pump motion.
-
Press PUSH Button to aspirate distilled water
-
To select one filter use the right and left arrows: (340nm 405nm, 505nm, 546nm, 578nm and 630nm)
-
Press wheel icon, the desired filter will be placed under the light beam
-
Look at all filters TENSION values.
-
To change filter, press PUSH BUTTON if you want to fill again water.
If you have a correct calibrated optical group, when you use the flow cell, the TENSION values are between 250
mV (for 340 nm) and about 3.5 V (for 630 nm) for all filters.
14/36
Regulate trimmer R1 to obtain 3,5 V on the Tension menu (see picture bellow):
4.5.3
In case that it is not possible to obtain such tension values:
-
Unscrew, to unblock the lamp
-
Find the maximum voltage moving slightly in several directions.
-
Then fix the lamp bloc with the screws

save. See also user manual.
-
Enter in Run method and run glucose.
-
Prepare 500 l of water in a cuvette set the aspiration tip in a bottom angle of manual cuvette and press
aspiration button.
-
If the pump works correctly, the water should be aspired completely from the manual cuvette, and
water should stop at the top of the aspiration tip.

HumaLyzer 3500 Service Manual
4.9.1
Humalyzer Hydraulic Layout:
After the complete aspiration (sample aspiration + air gap), if water stops after at beginning of aspiration tip or
stops to near the cuvette the red tube has a problem and you have to adjust aspiration by changing the aspiration
pump steps.
Aspiration regulation, proceed as follow:
1.
Enter in service menu and open Pump calibration menu.
2.
Increase “steps for 10ml” number to increase aspiration pump steps (the liquid will stop nearer to
cuvette). Use difference of +50 steps each try, then save.
3.
Decrease “steps for 10ml” number to decrease aspiration pump steps (the liquid will stop further to
cuvette). Use difference of -50 steps each try, then save.
4.
Exit from service.
5.
Enter in Run method and run glucose
6.
Prepare 500 l of water in a cuvette set the aspiration tip in a bottom angle of manual cuvette and press 
aspiration button.
7.
If the pump works correctly, the water should be aspired completely from the manual cuvette, and
water should stop at the top of the aspiration tip.
8.
After 5 seconds the air gap will be aspired and liquid front will rise up.
9.
Repeat operation several times
10. If the pump works correctly, the water should be aspired completely from the manual cuvette, and also
